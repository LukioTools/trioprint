# Project Name: TrioPrint

## Overview
TrioPrint is a 3D printing project designed to enhance the functionality and usability of 3D printers. This project leverages embedded systems and custom firmware to provide advanced features and improved performance.

## Features
- **Custom Firmware**: Tailored for 3D printing applications.
- **Device Integration**: Supports multiple hardware components.
- **Optimized Performance**: Ensures smooth and efficient operation.

## File Structure
- `device.h`: Contains hardware-specific definitions and configurations.
- `main.c`: Core logic and application entry point.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started
1. upload the html.
1. connect sd card to the esp32
2. Build and flash the firmware to esp32.
3. connect to the created WiFi network. open browser at 192.168.1.
4. do needed configuration
5. do testing. Upload file to the sd card and make sure everything is connected correctly.
6. connect esp32 to printer's uart port. You can't use usb port, instead you have to find the serial port from the motherboard.
7. power up the printer and
